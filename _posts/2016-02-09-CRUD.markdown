What is CRUD? It stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete - four basic functions of persistent storage, for example in databases, forms and reports.

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is a special purpose programming language for managing data held a RDBMS.


SQL examples for each CRUD action
---------------------------------

Create:
```
"INSERT INTO Users (username, password, fullname, email) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?
)";   
```

Read:
```
"SELECT * FROM Users";
```

Update:
```
"UPDATE Users SET password=?, fullname=?, email=? WHERE username=?";
```

Delete:
```
"DELETE FROM Users WHERE username=?";
```
