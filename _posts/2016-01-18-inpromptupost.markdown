Day 2 is over and I just felt the urge to blog, so rather than just think about blogging like I've always done before, I just opened Sublime and here we are.

Ever since I stumbled upon Makers Academy around a year ago, I promised myself that I'd invest some of my winnings on the virtual green felt into retraining for a career (and life) after poker, should I fail to teach myself and gain employment by late 2015.

I'm glad I failed, because here I am, studying at Makers Academy on their remote course, named Ronin. My fellow Ronin cohort consists of over 20 students, mostly from the UK, some from Europe and even one from over that big pond. 

I know its been said multiple times on other students blogs, but its so true that I need to write it on my own blog - learning in the correct environment alongside similarly passioned people really does make a huge difference to the amount of progress you can achieve in such a short timeframe. Its only been two days, but the amount of additional reading and studying is already stacking up, that I'm actually glad to be kept busy by it all. Immersion - thats what I signed up for, and I'll be happy to be drowning in work.

It makes for a pleasant change of scenery, compared to the annual SuperNova Elite chase for which I developed a love/hate relationship with. Since I started pair programming just over a week ago, I realised how much I'd been missing out on working with other people! 

What really impressed me on Day 1 was the focus on our development as 'aspiring software craftsmen', with Test Driven Development and Extreme Programming (XP) constantly being at the forefront of what we learn and create at Makers.

Its great to be able to have a learning framework on how to shape our mindsets on the path to becoming awesome developers - something I wish I had when I first entered the world of IT right after graduating. All I can remember is feeling a lot of frustration and lacking a sense of direction in my old job. So when Sam (our coach) mentioned that Makers selectively partners with companies that adhere to these principles, it felt very reassuring realising that my own past experiences in the work environment only apply to a small subset of employers.

Whilst I'd like to spend more time blogging, I look at the time and its already 9.30pm. I still have some evening study to do, so I'd better get back to it.
