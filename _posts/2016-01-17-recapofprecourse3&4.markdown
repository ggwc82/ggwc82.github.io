After a considerably long two week break over Christmas and New Year, I was eagerly waiting for Week 3 to start. So much so, when the e-mail from Nikesh dropped in my inbox around 1pm on the Monday, I got cracking right away. The week's challenge was to complete Chris Pine's Learn To Program Tutorial, chapters 9 to 14 along with the exercises. Although I had already covered chapters 1-8 in preparation for my interview way back in October, I did some additional study over the Christmas break which involved repeating Pine's tutorial and the Codecademy Ruby course. 

Week 3 concluded with no weekend challenge. I think this is because Nikesh saw that the majority of our cohort were still working their way through the book come Friday. In retrospect, had I not done that extra work during the holiday period, I too would have struggled to finish the book by Friday.


Week 4 - The final week of the Precourse! A relatively straightforward week, we were told to pair up with our fellow students and mentors for some Fizzbuzz coding with Test Driven Design, or TDD. As of right now, I'm still yet to be assigned a mentor, which hopefully should get resolved shortly. It seems that theres just too few seniors to go around, perhaps an indication of how fast the Ronin course is expanding. Nikesh alluded to there only being only 8 Ronin students in the previous cohort, compared to around 30 of us starting tomorrow.

I managed to pair with four of my fellow Ronin students, each time completing the Fizzbuzz exercise in a TDD way, adhering to the Red, Green and Refactor methodology. The experience of pair programming has really opened my eyes to how motivating and almost verging on being 'fun' pairing up can be. Since I didn't participate in a Makers taster day prior to accepting the position on January's course (all sessions leading up to my interview date were sold out) so it really was reassuring that I found the experience to be overall a very positive one. After all, pair programming is a core feature of the Ronin course at Makers Academy!

So thats a wrap for my recap of the Makers Academy 4 week precourse. For any future Makers looking to join the course, if you are reading this please be aware that the course content is dynamic - improvements and changes are based upon student feedback - so don't be too suprised if the precourse has drastically changed, because it will be for the better.
