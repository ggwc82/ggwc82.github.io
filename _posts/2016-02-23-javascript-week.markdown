So here we are again. Another week has flown by at Makers Academy, and I'm
struggling to recall what I've done over the past week. Week 5 was all about
JavaScript - for most of my cohort it was their first time coding in a totally
new language that wasn't Ruby, but for me it was more of a case of 'unfinished
business'. I had particular beef with JavaScript, having previously tried to
learn it along with the full MEAN stack last year.

How did I fare with it, second time around armed with some SOLID OOP
fundamentals that I've ingraned into my head (hopefully!) through coding in
Ruby? Well, the results are mixed. 

The successes are that I finally understood the preference to use the
constructor function as 'object factories' in comparison to defining individual
objects in literal form. Also, a win for understanding and using the prototype
method. I certainly feel that having a good knowledge of OOP fundamentals in one
language is definitely an advantage when learning other languages. The core
concepts are very similar, and it has proven to be the case. So I'm really happy
about that.

Another big win was that I'd finally got to see how we TDD in JavaScript! Having
never encountered TDD during my time working through a free online-based
bootcamp, I was entrigued as to how we'd actually do this given RSpec is for
Ruby only. The answer to this is with Jasmine.

Now onto the struggles. Despite the wins mentioned, I can't help but feel that
we've just had a small taster of the power of JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX.
Throughout the week, despite managing to TDD fizzbuzz, the Airport challenge and
create an interactive thermostat with jQuery on the front-end entirely in
JavaScript, I can't help but feel slightly disappointed that my familiarity with
writing JavaScript code hasn't changed that much. Perhaps I'm expecting too
much too early, or I'm briefly returning to my old ways of punishing myself.
Either or both of those. Whatever - it no longer matters.

I'll focus on the future. My reoccurring technological blockers (hey, thats
something new!) are currently databases (encryption, validation, signing up, in
and out), JavaScript, jQuery and CSS. These are the areas I'll be focusing on
this week as we've broken from the usual routine of a new topic each week.
Instead, Week 6 is project week, which I'll look forward to reviewing in the
next post.

Hopefully by then I'll have managed to work on those blockers since our project is to be based on a technology stack consisting of everything
 we've learned so far. Experimenting with stuff we've learned in new ways and at
the same time plugging leaks in our knowledge. This week couldn't have come
sooner!
