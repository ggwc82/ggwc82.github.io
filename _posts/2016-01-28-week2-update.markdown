This morning I volunteered to lead the daily stand ups, where we each take turns to answer the following three questions:

```
1. What did you learn yesterday?
2. What are you going to focus on today?
3. Do you currently have any blockers?
```

Just yesterday we starting to transition to self managing our own stand-ups, where previously our coach Sam had taken the lead. I found the experience to be refreshing, allowing me the opportunity to add some advice of my own, especially after listening to my peers voice their concerns as blockers.

It seems that we're all suffering from fatigue and sleep deprivation. We were given plenty of advanced warning that Makers would push our minds and bodies to their limits - well, they certainly weren't kidding. Our cohort is so big that I still haven't paired with half my peers yet, and we're rapidly approaching the end of week 2.

Every day at Makers is a different day, a new opportunity to start again. Just the matter of creating a new branch in our Git repos and away we code. I'm really enjoying the course right now, despite feeling super exhausted. Perhaps it doesn't show on my Ronin vlogs, somehow I managed to aquire a really serious poker face over the years, despite spending the majority of that time behind a couple of screens!

I'm not even going to watch my edited vlogs until after this experience is complete, in a way I think it'd be nice to look back across the horizon once I'd reached the summit of Mt. Makers, probably celebrate with a few drinks too! My original intentions of enrolling in this intensive bootcamp was to learn how to code, but as the days go by I feel like I've also signed up for an intensive bootcamp for self-improvement.

Every week we're given a new challenge, from which every stumbling block (and there are many) is an opportunity to learn from, to further both our technical knowledge and allow our mindsets to grow and become stronger.

Sam mentioned that around week 6 we'd have a strong enough foundations in Ruby to be able to pickup any other programming language and run with it. The core concepts between languages are shared, once you know one language its just a matter of figuring out the syntax and minor details. I can't wait to be able to take on JavaScript and AngularJS again, this time around I'll be armed with a much more 'SOLID' foundation of coding principles. Bring it on!
