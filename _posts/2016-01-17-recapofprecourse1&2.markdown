Week 1 - Introduction to the command line and Git. I've previously encountered the Unix command line on a Solaris course I'd taken many moons ago, and also having experienced the pains of DOS 6.2 in my youth, I didn't have much problems with the course material. Although one particular difficult topic did manage to show itself - regular expressions or regex. It's not the most intuitive or straighforward methods of parsing text, but I do know once mastered, it can be very powerful. Either way it cannot be avoided, so I'd better put aside some time to practice messing about with it.

The Git course, looking back now I must admit I've forgotten most of it, since we only use a few common commands like add, commit and push. I had trouble with one particular commit that I'd made so I struggled to find the correct command to remove it. Thus, my plan of action in the coming week is to complete the Codecademy courses for the command line and Git.

The 1st weekend challenge consisted of two parts - Unixoid and Octocat respectively. No prizes for guessing what they were based on, but if we manage to consistently complete them all each week, Nikesh promised he'll send us some stickers. Nice.


Week 2 - This week focused entirely on Ruby. We were advised to complete Sessions 1 & 2 of Josh Cheek's Ruby KickStart, video lectures and accompanying exercises. In particular, I found the 2nd session to be quite a leap in difficulty, and it was not until later after speaking to another student, that they felt that way too. We were advised not to spend more than 30 minutes working on each exercise, and to then refer to the provided model answers to study and absorb...

For the most part, I stuck to this rule. With one exception, and it involved ninety-nine beers (imaginery beers, of course). A common mistake of beginner programmers is to try to solve problems with sheer brainpower, spending many hours frustratingly trying to get their code just to pass the solution checks, in any way possible. I was certainly guilty of this ineffective approach when I completed MIT's Python courses in CS & and Data Science early last year. What resulted was that I averaged around 90% in both courses, but failed to get a solid grasp of Python fundamentals at the sake of collecting green ticks.

It really just boils down to ego. I have to accept that I know very little, and that I am expected to make many mistakes whilst I'm learning. It doesn't matter if I can manage to solve a problem without looking at the solution (or Googling), what really matters is that I take the time to understand fully, the methods I'm using in my solutions.

Week 2's weekend challenge was to finish off the week's work if we had not done so already, and also to obtain 40-50 points on Codewars katas. Codewars was something I was familiar with already, so gaining enough points to complete the weekend challenge was just a simple matter of putting the hours in to level up.
