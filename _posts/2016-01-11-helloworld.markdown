Really, what else would you expect from a blog about coding? I've been meaning to blog for a while now, blogspot or blogger wasn't an appealing choice since I used them previously for my poker blogs. I even went as far as setting up a medium blog account but didn't get as far as writing my first post. So what was holding me back, until right now?

The answer is this - thinking about it too much. Bruce Lee once said "If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done."

That aside, my blogging platform I've chosen is Jekyll. It relys on Github as a host, so the usual CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methology of Github (add, commit, push etc) applies. I figured that as I made a career choice to become a developer, I might as well push the boundaries of my own comfort zone and try figuring out how to get my own blog up and running. The extra github practice can be considered a bonus. 

Another main reason that was stopping me from blogging <del>is</del> <del>was</del> still is a fear of making mistakes, and looking stupid from making them. Yes, even after all this time as an online professional poker player, I'm still scared of making them. It was only until last week I came across a recommended blogpost on Medium, where the author basically said something along the lines of your first blog posts will suck. This holds true with everything in life, you're gonna suck, and get stuck at the beginning. Coding is no different to this. Its a very basic lesson, but something I need to tell myself often.

So here it is, my first blogpost. Its by no means perfect, but I've written it, and if you're reading this, it's already been Git added, committed and pushed. My second post will be focused on a look back of the first three weeks of my Makers Academy pre-course, what I've learned so far and what I'm looking forward to as we near to the start of the 12 weeks intensive bootcamp.
