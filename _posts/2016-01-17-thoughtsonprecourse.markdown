It's Sunday afternoon right now, and the Weekend challenge set by Nikesh is just to...

relax.

Because, as he explained in his e-mail, its the last weekend we'll get. I assume that means for the next 12 weeks, our weekends will be forfeit - they don't call it an intensive and immersive bootcamp for no reason!

Besides relaxing, we were expected to make sure we'd all finished the precourse work and challenges, ensure our learning plans are up-to-date and our CI checks, green. All looking good from here, I even managed to record my vlog this morning, an improvement on previous weeks.

Regarding the vlogs, when Jordan (at Makers) propositioned me with the weekly vlog request, I didn't accept right away - I took a few days to think it through. I'd never done anything like this before - I'm far from being comfortable infront of a camera - I decided to accept his offer and just do it. Tackling my fears head on is one of the reasons why I signed for Makers Academy, so it just made complete sense. I just hope that I come across reasonably well in the videos after the editing wizards have performed their magic.
