Hello again. It's been over 2 weeks since I graduated from Makers Academy, and a very long time since I last wrote in this blog. I won't be recapping the final few weeks nor the final project, if you're really interested then please do take the time to check out the Ronin vlogs on the MA youtube page. I've been told there's one final video I need to make, and that's a week after I get my first job as a junior developer.

On the final day of our course, I took the opportunity to head into Makers for the careers fair. Not only did I meet some of my fellow Roniners and Makers staff, but I also got to talk to some of the hiring partners that were onsite. This initial meet helped me secure an interview with one tech company, but unfortunately it just wasn't to be.

We have been told by Makers to prepare for a marathon rather than a sprint in the job hunting process. Despite this sage advice, I was surprised at how quick some of the hiring partners were at moving forward with placing MA graduates. One particular company held an onsite open session which I attended, and I felt really impressed by. A FinTech consultancy with global banking clients, producing software on multiple platforms including Java and iOS. They were looking at taking on 5 MA graduates. Just the matter of an initial tech test first in Java to be in the running.

Despite this being an awesome opportunity, it came at the wrong time for me. Besides having a busy week of life events and preparing for my other interview, I just felt completely burnt out. The whole MA course, adjusting back to normal life (and there was a lot of adjusting, having literally not spent any time with my family during the whole course) and the amount of extra effort I put into the final project has left me feeling totally exhausted.

Besides preparing for tech tests, I haven't actually been coding since finishing MA. They told us this was really important to do, and I just haven't been motivated to do so. Whilst it was much easier during the course - I had 'borrowed' my daughter's room for the duration - now I have parental responsibilities again and it's really tough trying to set aside time not just for job hunting, but also just for coding.

The only solution out of this loop would be to take a break, and thats what I intend to do at the end of this month. No Slack messages, no emails, no twitter, just for one week. When I get back I can resume the job search with renewed focus. Just like on the course, many problems seem to somehow resolve themselves when I take a step away from the computer.

So that's it. My Makers Academy Ronin experience, January 2016 cohort. It's been a rollercoaster of a ride with many highs and lows. If you'd like to get in touch with me to offer me a job (please!) or would like to ask me about Makers or Ronin, my contacts are on the main page of this blog, or just tweet me @gotwai. Thanks for reading!
