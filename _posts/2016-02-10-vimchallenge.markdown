So a bunch of us from the Ronin cohort were talking about learning VIM over the
past week. So we decided to create VIM Club. There was already a Slack channel
named 'vimming' created by the supreme being known as Nikesh (where's my stickers dude?) so like an invading horde we stormed that channel and made it our own.

We've all heard about how steep the learning curve is for VIM, however whats harder - learning Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, TDD etc. in 12 weeks or learning one tool created way back in the 90s. I figured I'm in the optimal environment and surrounded by similarly motivated people to make sure I succeed at this. And succeed I will, because I deleted my Sublime Text 2 last night. That's how committed I am. There is no going back.

I used to use my mouse a lot. In fact, I've had so many over the years - Razer,
Logitech, Steelseries, all gaming mice which I mainly used for playing Poker,
but sometimes for light sessions of Counter-Strike, Diablo 3 and LoL. You could
say I'm quite attached to them, but I quickly found them to be a burden for
coding, especially since one's hands are fixed on the keyboard and then having to reach over...

You might think its a minor issue, but if you're having to do this constantly,
you end up wasting so much time. One thing that Makers has taught me is
that there is never enough time - and its so precious. Very very precious, like a
gleaming red gem.

When I first started playing poker, I couldn't 24 table right away. I had to
work at it, even 4 tabling was difficult for me in the beginning. But that didn't
discourage me. I worked at it. I got better, day by day. I researched into how
to optimize my setup, with additional software like Hold'em Manager and Table
Ninja for hotkeys and managing the position of poker tables on my screens.

I read a lot and experimented with many different setups, different mice, multiple screens etc. I knew I was going to spend a lot of time playing an insane amount of poker, so it's importance was right up there alongside improving my own game. Put simply, more tables == more hands of poker == more $/ph. And thats how I managed to play millions of hand on PokerStars every year and achieve SuperNova Elite status not once, but four times.

So coding is no different. Investing the time and energy at the start will allow
me to gain the rewards sooner rather than later. Right now, I've only spent a
couple of weeks getting used to Sublime Text 2, but I'm by no means an expert at
it. Better to leave it now before I get too familiar, too 'good' at using it
that the move away would be significantly harder. And it will only get tougher if I
don't make the move now. So there it is, my reasoning for why I made the move to
VIM. Also, the bragging rights of being a quintessential 'keyboard warrior'
might even make up for losing my 'SNE' status at PokerStars...maybe...
